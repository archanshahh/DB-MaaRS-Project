# DB-MaaRS-Project

Description:
DB-MaaRS (Database of Mutations in aaRSs) is a website used to
visualize user-defined mutations on cytoplasmic or mitochondrion
protein sequences and also exhibits 3D structure of the selected
protein.

Installation:
You'll need a Xampp server to get access to database and set up php environment to run the project.

Usage:
Open phpstorm folder and open file named HomePage.php and run in order to use website.
Home Page has basic info about what this project is all about and some explaination about biology jargons.
Press Try Mutations tab and you will be redirected to a form where you can enter requested info to see the mutations done on protein sequence.
Example:
Select Cytoplasm: GRS(II) and enter mutation "arg5ala" which whill show how would mutated protein will look like on next page.
Output is displayed in tabular format. By the end of that page you will see 3D object of protein(if available) and you will be 
able to download pdf as well as e-mail the same.

NOTE:
For detailed documentation, look for DB-MaaRS.pptx in php storm folder.
